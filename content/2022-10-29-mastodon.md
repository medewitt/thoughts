# Moving to mastodon

So Elon bought Twitter.
I have always been a bit ambivalent about using platforms in which I am the product.
In some cases the ends justify the means, but someone who outwardly endorses things I am vehemently against is something of which I will not put.
I'm going to spend more time blogging, coding, and tooting[^1] at @medewitt@mastodon.social.

[^1]: yeah I know that will take some getting used to.
