# Helper functions needed for Julia

There are some really nice packages in R that need Julia ports.
I really have been enjoying using Julia but it reminds me of Base R when I first started using it (e.g., pre-tidyverse).
The easystats suite looks really nice and ripe for a port:

Like [converting between odds ratios](https://github.com/easystats/effectsize/blob/fccb956e20b8cc688dae38abd625b28a760f376e/R/convert_between_OR_to_RR.R)

```.R
oddsratio_to_riskratio.numeric <- function(OR, p0, log = FALSE, ...) {
  if (log) OR <- exp(OR)

  RR <- OR / (1 - p0 + (p0 * OR))

  if (log) RR <- log(RR)
  return(RR)
}
```

Could be

```.julia
function oddsratio_to_riskratio(OR, p0, log = false)
  
  if log
    OR = exp(OR)
  end
  
  RR = OR / (1 - p0 + (p0 * OR))
  
  if log
    RR = log(RR)
  end
  
  return RR
end
```
