# Suitability of Engineering to Bayes

I was listening to the [learning Bayesian statistics podcast](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5jYXB0aXZhdGUuZm0vbGVhcm5iYXllc3N0YXRzLw?ep=14) in which the host interview [Justin Bois](http://bois.caltech.edu/) of Cal Tech.
When listening to how Justin came into statistics from chemical engineering (a story similar to my own), I was struck with how natural the transition from engineering is to Bayes..
My first serious introduction to applied statistics was through projects designed to identify process variation.
The experienced engineers all taught me that variation is natural, something you want to reduce in manufacturing, but never something that could be eliminated.
That comfort with not having a fixed number led to higher comfort with probabilistic reasoning.
More to write on this later.
