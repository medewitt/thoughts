# Writing in 2023

Happy New Year! I hope to be engaged a little more in blogging this year, especially as Twitter seems to be imploding. Someone once told me it is good luck to do a few of things you want to do on New Year Day in order to set the tone for a sucessful day. This normally means reading, writing, thinking, and spending time with family. So I'll try to start this process right.
