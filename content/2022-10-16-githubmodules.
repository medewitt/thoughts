# GitHub Submodules

Not too much to say on this topic other than I think that is is my new favorite tool

Modules allow you to better encapsulate code by placing subdirectories in their own repository.
These can then be added using the :

```
git submodule add URL
```

Then you can be off to the races.
This also solves some of the problems with trying to deploy websites at a subdomain using a third party service
