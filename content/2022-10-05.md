# Hello, World, Again!

This simple markdown based microblogging platform is my attempt to capture thoughts that aren't quite ready for a full blog post.
Blogging takes a lot of energy that could be used to write full manuscripts or more generally not be on the computer.
I hope[^1] that this will be a medium group for this kind of free form thinking.
